# Programming Bitcoin in Scala

Exercises from [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/)
but in Scala.

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
